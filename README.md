# Twitter Sentiment Analysis â€“ Reports

This repository contains three reports prepared as part of a university course on Natural Language Processing. Each report focuses on a different methodology for sentiment classification on Twitter data. The code is not published in this repository; only the reports are included.

## Contents

- **Project 1: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression**  
  A classical machine learning baseline using TF-IDF features and a logistic regression classifier.
